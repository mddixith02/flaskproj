    <h2>What is Flask?</h2>
    <p>Flask is a small framework by most standards, small enough to be called a “microframework.” It is small enough that once you become familiar with it, you will likely be
        able to read and understand all of its source code.
        But being small does not mean that it does less than other frameworks. Flask was de‐
        signed as an extensible framework from the ground up; it provides a solid core with the
        basic services, while extensions provide the rest. Because you can pick and choose the
        extension packages that you want, you end up with a lean stack that has no bloat and
        does exactly what you need.
        Flask has two main dependencies. The routing, debugging, and Web Server Gateway
        Interface (WSGI) subsystems come from Werkzeug, while template support is provided
        by Jinja2. Werkzeug and Jinja2 are authored by the core developer of Flask. 
        There is no native support in Flask for accessing databases, validating web forms, au‐
        thenticating users, or other high-level tasks. These and many other key services most
        web applications need are available through extensions that integrate with the core
        packages. As a developer, you have the power to cherry-pick the extensions that work
        best for your project or even write your own if you feel inclined to. This is in contrast
        with a larger framework, where most choices have been made for you and are hard or
        sometimes impossible to change.</p>
